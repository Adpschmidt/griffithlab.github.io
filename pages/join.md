Trainees interested in joining the lab may find the following suggestions/resources useful:

* Use [Biostars.org](https://www.biostars.org/). It contains many posts with suggestions of books, websites, and courses focused on bioinformatics.
Learn R. For those focused on the analysis/translation end of bioinformatics, this is the single most powerful tool.
* Learn at least one scripting language (Perl or Python). [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python) has a good Python intro.
* Learn some Ruby/Rails and/or Javascript. We are increasingly creating web resources such as [dgidb.org](http://dgidb.org/), [docm.info](http://docm.info/) and [civicdb.org](https://civicdb.org/home).
* Take at least some formal computer science training (one or two introductory computer science courses).
* Learn at least basics of good software development practices: for example, software version control (e.g., github).
* Develop key skills such as statistics (classic stats and monte carlo methods), machine learning, data wrangling, and other big data techniques.
* Have at least some hands-on familiarity with wet lab molecular biology (sequencing protocols, tissue culture, PCR, etc.).
