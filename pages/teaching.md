Drs Griffith guest lecture regularly for a number of courses at Washington University School of Medicine including Special Topics in Molecular Genetics: Molecular Basis of Cancer (BIO5288), Genetics and Genomics of Disease (BIO5487), Human Linkage and Association (M21-5483/L41-5483), and Genomics in Medicine I/II (M17-532/533). Drs Griffith also coordinate the Cancer Informatics Journal Club (L41-BIOL5499) and Dr Obi Griffith is course master for Genomics in Medicine. Furthermore, the Griffith Lab is deeply committed to providing open source educational resources to aid the bioinformatics community. To this end we maintain online courses and deliver periodic workshops (see below). Furthermore, we and many members of the lab are actively engaged in community forums such as [BioStars](https://www.biostars.org/).

### Online Courses
1. [RNAseq tutorial](https://github.com/griffithlab/rnaseq_tutorial/wiki) Informatics for RNA-seq: A web resource for analysis on the cloud. Educational tutorials and working pipelines for RNA-seq analysis including an introduction to: cloud computing, critical file formats, reference genomes, gene annotation, expression, differential expression, alternative splicing, data visualization, and interpretation.
2. [Genomic Visualizations](http://genviz.org/) in-depth tutorial in the interpretation and visualization of omic data. Among the topics we will cover are: “Genome Browsing and Interpretation”, “Differential Expression and Pathway Analysis”, “Best in Class tools for visualization”, and others. Students should have a background in biology and a basic knowledge of the R programming language and linux.
