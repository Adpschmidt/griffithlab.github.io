### Principal Investigator

{% include team_member member_name="Malachi" bio="<stron>Malachi Griffith</strong> is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Assistant Director of the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine. He has more than 13 years of experience in the fields of genomics, bioinformatics, data mining, and cancer research. His research is focused on improving our understanding of cancer biology and the development of personalized medicine strategies for cancer using genomics and informatics technologies. He develops bioinformatics and statistical methods for the analysis of high throughput sequence data and identification of biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic and drug response prediction." image="/assets/img/team/MG14.jpg" role="Principle Investigator" %}

### Postdoctoral Researchers
{% include team_member member_name="Alex" bio='<strong>Alex Wagner</strong> is an <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/training/funding/f32">NCI Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at the McDonell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine. His research interests are in facilitating the interpretation of genomic variants in a clinical context. He leads development of the <a href="http://dgidb.org">Drug Gene Interaction Database</a>, and is a primary contributor to other projects centered on interpretations of genomic variants (<a href="http://docm.info">Database of Curated Mutations</a>, <a href="http://civicdb.org">Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer</a>) and <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenVisR.html">Genomic Visualizations in R</a>. Alex is an active member of the <a href="http://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a> (GA4GH), and is leading an effort to aggregate and normalize the disparate knowledgebases of the GA4GH <a href="http://cancervariants.org">Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium</a>. He is also currently studying the role of genomic variants in cancers and leading a study characterizing relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancers with Drs. <a href="http://obigriffith.org/">Obi Griffith</a>, <a href="http://obigriffith.org/">Malachi Griffith</a>, and <a href="http://oncology.wustl.edu/people/faculty/Govindan/Govindan_Bio.html">Ramaswamy Govindan</a>.' image="/assets/img/team/alex_wagner.jpg" role="Postdoctoral Fellow" %}

### Graduate Students

{% include team_member member_name="Yang" bio="<strong>Yang-Yang Feng</strong>is a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis, and is currently conducting a year of research in the Griffith Lab. He completed his undegraduate at Yale University in 2016, where he obtained a B.S. in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry. Broadly speaking, he is interested in applying mathematical and computational techniques to investigating the fundamental principles of cancer immunology and translating these discoveries into novel immmunotherapies. More specifically, he is involved in a diverse set of projects in the lab, including CIViC, DGIdb, pVACTools, Regtools, and various collaborative clinical efforts." image="/assets/img/team/yangyang_feng.png" role="Graduate Student/MD" %}

{% include team_member member_name="Kelsy" bio="<strong>Kelsy Cotto</strong>is a graduate student in the Molecular Cell Biology program at Washington University in St. Louis. She completed her undergraduate degree at Mercer University in 2016, where she earned a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. she is interested in developing methods to analyze multiple types of sequencing data in order to better understand regulatory mutations and splicing within cancer, with the hope of identifying novel biomarkers. Currently, she is involved with DGIdb, Regtools, and analysis of large scale clinical cohorts." image="/assets/img/team/kelsy_cotto.jpg" role="Graduate Student" %}

### Staff

{% include team_member member_name="Zach" bio="<strong>Zachary Skidmore</strong> is a staff scientist at the McDonell Genome Institute at Washington University in Saint Louis. His undergraduate work was completed at the Ohio State University where he obtained a B.Sc. in molecular biology. His Graduate work was performed at the University of Illinois where he obtained a M.eng in bioinformatics. His research focus is in the realm of cancer biology where he uses and develops tools and techniques to aid in the analysis and interpretation of cancer sequencing data. He has worked on several large sequencing projects across many cancer types and has expertise in a variety of languages (perl, R, bash, python, typescript, angular2). He is also the creator and maintainer of the bioconductor package GenVisR, a graphics program designed to help visualize cohort level genomic data." image="/assets/img/team/zachary_skidmore.jpg" role="Staff Scientist/Bioinformatician" %}
