### Principal Investigator

{% include team_member member_name="Malachi" bio="I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Assistant Director of the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine. I have more than 13 years of experience in the fields of genomics, bioinformatics, data mining, and cancer research. My research is focused on improving our understanding of cancer biology and the development of personalized medicine strategies for cancer using genomics and informatics technologies. I develop bioinformatics and statistical methods for the analysis of high throughput sequence data and identification of biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic and drug response prediction." image="/assets/img/team/MG14.jpg" role="Principle Investigator" %}

### Graduate Students

{% include team_member member_name="Yang" bio="I am a medical student at Washington University in St. Louis, currently conducting a year of research in the Griffith Lab. I completed my undegraduate at Yale University in 2016, where I obtained a B.S. in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry. Broadly speaking, I am interested in applying mathematical and computational techniques to investigating the fundamental principles of cancer immunology and translating these discoveries into novel immmunotherapies. More specifically, I am involved in a diverse set of projects in the lab, including CIViC, DGIdb, pVACTools, Regtools, and various collaborative clinical efforts." image="/assets/img/team/yangyang_feng.png" role="Graduate Student/MD" %}

{% include team_member member_name="Kelsy" bio="I am a graduate student in the Molecular Cell Biology program at Washington University in St. Louis. I completed my undergraduate degree at Mercer University in 2016, where I earned a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I am interested in developing methods to analyze multiple types of sequencing data in order to better understand regulatory mutations and splicing within cancer, with the hope of identifying novel biomarkers. Currently, I am involved with DGIdb, Regtools, and analysis of large scale clinical cohorts." image="/assets/img/team/kelsy_cotto.png" role="Graduate Student" %}

### Postdoctoral Researchers

### Staff

{% include team_member member_name="Zach" bio="Zachary Skidmore is a staff scientist at the McDonell Genome Institute at Washington University in Saint Louis. His undergraduate work was completed at the Ohio State University where he obtained a B.Sc. in molecular biology. Graduate work was performed at the University of Illinois where he obtained a M.eng in bioinformatics. His research focus is in the realm of cancer biology where he uses and develops tools and techniques to aid in the analysis and interpretation of cancer sequencing data. He have worked on several large sequencing projects across many cancer types and has expertise in a variety of languages (perl, R, bash, python, typescript, angular2). He is the creator and maintainer of the bioconductor package GenVisR, a graphics program designed to help visualize cohort level genomic data." image="/assets/img/team/zachary_skidmore.jpg" role="Staff Scientist/Bioinformatician" %}
