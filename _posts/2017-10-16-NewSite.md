A first draft of the griffith lab site is now live. The site uses the static site generator [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is based on the [feeling responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive) theme. The site uses [jquery-backstretch](https://github.com/jquery-backstretch/jquery-backstretch) (2.1.16) to control full width background images and uses the [foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) (5.5.3) front end framework.

### key changes

The site features a number of key differences in contrast to the [feeling responsive](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive) theme however all of the old functionality remains in place. In brief these differences are:

1. Uses an updated [jquery-backstretch](https://github.com/jquery-backstretch/jquery-backstretch)
2. Blog functionality has been repurposed for a news feed
3. custom templates have been designed for publications and team members.
4. structure of the _data/socialmedia.yml file has been changed
5. added and rebuilt icons from the [entypo+](http://www.entypo.com/) library.

### development

development of this site occurs on the "master" branch at [https://github.com/griffithlab/griffithlab.github.io](https://github.com/griffithlab/griffithlab.github.io). The live site is published on the "live" branch and is periodically synced with "master". To begin development follow the instructions on the README on the site github page. The _drafts folder contains helpfull examples for various aspects of the site.

### adding team members

Additional team members can be added by altering the pages/team.md file. When adding team members the team_member template located in at _includes/team_member should be used. The syntax for this is as follows:

{% raw %}
~~~~
 {% include team_member member_name="" full_name="" bio="" image="/assets/img/team/" role="" %}
~~~~
{% endraw %}

The member_name parameter should match that in _data/socialmedia.yml and is used to add social media links. Further the image to include should be located in /assets/img/team/.

### adding publications

Publications can be added by altering the pages/publication.md file. When doing so the following syntax should be followed where pmid is the pubmed id and doi is the digital object identifier:
{% raw %}
~~~~
 {% include publication authors="" journal="" doi="" pmid=""%}
~~~~
{% endraw %}
